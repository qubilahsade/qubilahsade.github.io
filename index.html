      Communion&copy; is an online resource created to facilitate the sharing  exchange of intimate thoughts and feelings between black women -- especially those who find themselves on the front line of fighting social &amp; racial injustice. While we must unapologetically love ourselves, loving within a community sustains us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired after reading bell hooks' "Communion: The Female Search for Love", the founder launched Communion to help affirm and uplift women who have &amp; continue to endure roads less traveled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the hope that through this space, women from across the globe, -- whether corporate or self-employed, spiritual or not-so-spiritual, free-spirited or a caged-bird --   will find solidarity, love, &amp; sisterhood.
